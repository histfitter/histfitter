scripts for submission of batch jobs 

-------------------------------------

IN GENERAL: 

-you need to modify the paths in the following scripts:
  *submit_susy.sh
  *submit_susy_main_tree.sh
  *submit_susy_tree.sh
  *runSusyLimitBatch2.sh
  *runSusyLimitBatch3.sh
  
  
-you need to move the following files to your submit directory (usually SusyFitter):
  * analysis/batchjobs/submit_susy_main.sh
  * analysis/batchjobs/submit_susy_main_tree.sh  
  * analysis/batchjobs/submit_susy.sh
  * analysis/batchjobs/submit_susy_tree.sh   
  * analysis/batchjobs/susy_points4.txt
  * analysis/batchjobs/susy_points3.txt  
  * analysis/batchjobs/runSusyLimitBatch2.sh
  * analysis/batchjobs/runSusyLimitBatch3.sh  
  
- you need to move the following files to your output directory:
  * macros/macros_jlorenz/check_results.py
  * macros/macros_jlorenz/hadd_script.py  

-------------------------------------

Submission of batch jobs:

1. Prepare the workspace:
   (-> This corresponds to HistFitter.py -t -w config_file.py)
   
   sh submit_susy_main_tree.sh
   
   This will submit 12 jobs with in total 863 MSUGRA grid points. It will load susy_points4.txt.
   For each list of input points it will call submit_susy_tree.sh.
   submit_susy_tree.sh will submit the batch job.
   It will call runSusyLimitBatch2.sh.
   runSusyLimitBatch2.sh will create some directories on the batch node and copy the some input files to it.
   It will also copy the output to the output directory. *** MAKE SURE YOU UPDATE THE OUTPUT DIR IN runSusyLimitBatch2.sh ***
   It will execute python scripts/HistFitter.py -t -w python/MyOneLeptonKtScale_onepoint.py  # *** MAKE SURE YOU UPDATE THE CONFIG FILE ***
   python/MyOneLeptonKtScale_onepoint.py is similar to python/MyOneLeptonKtScale.py, but no signal samples are specified and the ATLAS macro is turned off.
   
2. Perform the hypothesis fit:
   *** MAKE SURE YOU UPDATE THE OUTPUT DIR IN runSusyLimitBatch3.sh ***

   (-> this corresponds to HistFitter.py -p config_file.py)
   
   sh submit_susy_main.sh
   
   This will submit one batch job for any of the signal points. 
   The points are defined in susy_points3.txt.
   submit_susy_main.sh will call for every point submit_susy.sh which will submit the batch job.
   The batch job will execute runSusyLimitBatch3.sh.
   This will create some directories on the batch node, copy the root file with the workspace to the batch node, 
   perform the hypothesis test and cp the result back to the output directory.
   runSusyLimitBatch3.sh will call scripts/HypoTest.py.
   This script is a modified clone from doHypoTestAll() which takes the root file with the workspace as input.
   The hypothesis test result will be stored in the output directory as <grid_point>_hypotestresult/MyOneLeptonKtScaleFitR17_Output_hypotest.root
   
3. Combine the output files:

   sh hadd_script.sh
   
   will hadd all <grid_point>_hypotestresult/MyOneLeptonKtScaleFitR17_Output_hypotest.root to MyOneLeptonKtScaleFitR17_Output_hypotest.root   
   check if all points are there with:
   
   python check_results.py

Contour plots:

Consult README in macros/contourplot

In principle:

root -b -q makelistfiles.C
root -b -q makecontourhists.C
root -b -q makecontourplots.C

Make sure that you've modified the paths in these files to point to your input files.
makecontourplots.C will call contourmacros/SUSY_m0_vs_m12_all_withBand_cls.C, the main plotting macro.
