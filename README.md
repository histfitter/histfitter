## Contact

The HistFitter Group mailing-list, for **any** of your questions: <atlas-phys-susy-histfitter@cern.ch>

## Acquire

If you're going to be using HistFitter directly as a standalone application, clone the latest stable release

```
git clone ssh://git@gitlab.cern.ch:7999/HistFitter/HistFitter.git
git checkout v0.65.0 -b v0.65.0
```

If you're using HistFitter as a submodule in a project, specify the latest stable release while adding the submodule

```
# Relative path gives nicer clones in CI if parent project on CERN's GitLab
git submodule add ../../HistFitter/HistFitter.git
cd HistFitter && git checkout v0.65.0 -b v0.65.0 && cd ..
git add HistFitter && git commit -m "Add HistFitter submodule"
```


## Setup

If you're on a machine with CVMFS you can setup using

```
source setup.sh
```

and if you're on LXPLUS and want to use AFS you can setup using

```
source setup_afs.sh
```

### Recommended Root version

The setup files automatically point at the recommended ROOT version to use.
These reside on AFS.
Have a look at the setup script if you would like to modify the ROOT version.
