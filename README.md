## Acquire
HistFitter has 2 stable versions, one complient with Python2 (v0.66.0) and one with Python3 (v1.x.y).
If you're going to be using HistFitter directly as a standalone application, clone the latest stable release.  The Python2 version is no longer being updated.

```
git clone https://github.com/histfitter/histfitter
git checkout vX.XX.X -b vX.XX.X
```

If you're using HistFitter as a submodule in a project, specify the latest stable release while adding the submodule

```
# Relative path gives nicer clones in CI if parent project on CERN's GitLab
git submodule add ../../HistFitter/HistFitter.git
cd HistFitter && git checkout vX.XX.X -b vX.XX.X && cd ..
git add HistFitter && git commit -m "Add HistFitter submodule"
```


### Recommended Root version

Recommended Root version is 6.26.08.  This version of HistFitter is not compatible with ROOT versions < 6.26.


## Build
From the root folder do
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake  ..
make install
```
This will create a lib folder with the installed libraries.

or make your build directory anywhere and specify install directory:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install/ /path/to/histfitter/
make install
```
Then you have to add the library path manually to access it:
```
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/path/to/install/lib/
```

## Setup

The environment can be set by activating the setup script in the root folder

```
source /path/to/histfitter/setup.sh
```

## Workflow

Start by making a folder for your project. Then you must create a 'samples' folder within that folder.

## Directory structure source code

- `analysis`: Contains all files related to an analysis. E.g. `ZeroLepton/`
- `doc`: Documentation
- `examples`: Example scripts that use the libraries in `python/`
- `lib`: Location shared library
- `macros`: Macros for making plots, testing the fit, ongoing work, etc
- `python`: Python base classes
- `scripts`: Scripts for making workspaces based on text files in data/ . Scripts for submitting batch jobs.
- `src`: Source code to make workspaces, do toys.
- `test`: pytest tests

## Directory structure working folder

- `config` : Contains HistFactory schema
- `results`: Where root files with workspaces generated by HistFactory get stored- `config`: Contains HistFactory schema
- `data`: Contains data text files, provided externally, used to create workspaces for analysis
- `samples`: 

## Contributing
