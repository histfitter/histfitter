## Acquire
HistFitter has 2 stable versions, one complient with Python2 (v0.66.0) and one with Python3 (v1.x.y).
If you're going to be using HistFitter directly as a standalone application, clone the latest stable release. The Python2 version is no longer being updated.

```
git clone https://github.com/histfitter/histfitter
git checkout vX.XX.X -b vX.XX.X
```

If you're using HistFitter as a submodule in a project, specify the latest stable release while adding the submodule

```
# Relative path gives nicer clones in CI if parent project on CERN's GitLab
git submodule add ../../HistFitter/HistFitter.git
cd HistFitter && git checkout vX.XX.X -b vX.XX.X && cd ..
git add HistFitter && git commit -m "Add HistFitter submodule"
```
